    "# 🎯 LeetCode 452: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons — Quick Review\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 Problem Summary\n",
    "You're given a list of balloon intervals `[xstart, xend]` representing the horizontal range of each balloon on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can shoot an arrow **vertically upward** at any x position.  \n",
    "It will burst **all balloons whose range covers that x-coordinate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal: **shoot the minimum number of arrows** to burst all balloons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Key Idea\n",
    "This is a classic **interval scheduling / greedy overlap** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➤ Insight  \n",
    "If balloons overlap, **one arrow can burst all overlapping balloons**.  \n",
    "So we want to group overlapping intervals and use one arrow per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Greedy Strategy  \n",
    "**Sort balloons by their end coordinate** (`xend`).  \n",
    "Then:\n",
    "- Shoot an arrow at the end of the first balloon.\n",
    "- For each next balloon:\n",
    "  - If it overlaps (i.e., `start <= current_arrow_position`), it gets burst automatically.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, shoot a new arrow and set the new arrow position to this balloon’s end.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures **minimum arrows** (same as \"minimum number of intervals to cover points\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✏️ Approach (O(n log n) Sorting + O(n) Scan)\n",
    "1. Sort `points` by `xend` (ascending).\n",
    "2. Initialize:\n",
    "   - `arrows = 1`\n",
    "   - `last_arrow_pos = points[0][1]`\n",
    "3. Iterate remaining balloons:\n",
    "   - If `xstart <= last_arrow_pos`: it overlaps → continue.\n",
    "   - Else: shoot a new arrow → `arrows += 1`, update `last_arrow_pos`.\n",
    "4. Return `arrows`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Example\n",
    "Input:  \n",
    "`[[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted by end →  \n",
    "`[[1,6],[2,8],[7,12],[10,16]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrows:\n",
    "- Arrow at `6` bursts first two.\n",
    "- Next balloon starts at `7` → need new arrow at `12`.\n",
